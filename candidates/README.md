Some candidates have multiple fecids. `corrections_fecids.csv` exists to deal with this issue. For any fecid (first column), the second column specifies what it should be changed to. If a candidate had 3 fecids, and let's say the first one is the correct one, then they would simply have two rows, one with 2 -> 1, and one with 3 -> 1. The third column is purely cosmetic, just so it's easier to remember who is who.
